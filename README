A fuse filesystem that takes an original path to a directory with flac-files
and provides these files that are convolved on the fly using the zita convolver
(usually used in jconvolve).

=== To compile on Ubuntu ===

  $ sudo aptitude install libsndfile-dev libflac-dev libzita-convolver-dev libfuse-dev fftw3-dev libboost-dev
  $ make

=== Run ===

  ./fuse-convolve /directory/with/filters /path/to/original/fileystem /mnt/mountpoint -f

Parameters:
  1) The /directory/with/filters needs to be a directory that has
     jconvolver filter-configuration files with the following naming:

       filter-<samplerate>-<bits>-<channels>.conf

     So if you have flac files with 44.1khz, 16 bits and 2 channel stero,
     you need a filter configuration named:

     /directory/with/filters/filter-44100-16-2.conf


  2) The original directory that contains the *.flac files.

  3) The mount point.


The '-f' option lets it run in foreground (useful, since right now this
spits out some debugging information.

Now you can access the fileystem under that mount point, e.g.
  mplayer /mnt/mountpoint/foo.flac

The fuse-convolve filesystem will determine the samplerate/bits/channels and
attempt to find the right filter in the filter directory. If there is a filter,
the output is filtered on-the-fly, otherwise the original file is returned.
