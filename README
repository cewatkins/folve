		            Folve - Fuse Convolve
	 A fuse filesystem with on-the-fly convolving of sound files

This fuse filesystem takes an original path to a directory with flac-files
and provides these files at the mount point. Accessing sound files will
automatically convolve these on-the-fly using the zita convolver by
Fons Adriaensen (Files in this directory starting with zita-* are imported
from his jconvolver project to parse the same configuration files).

This solves the problem that many media servers don't provide a convolving
option and their only interface to the outside world is to access a file
system.
Also in general the beauty of simply accessing files to convolve is very
useful and allows for simple experiments.

This project is based on
Fuse: Filesystem in Userspace   http://fuse.sourceforge.net/
JConvolver Jack audio convolver http://apps.linuxaudio.org/apps/all/jconvolver

Folve has been tested with various players and music servers (and
workes around bugs in these). Still, this is the first version made public, so
you should expect rough edges.

=== To compile on Ubuntu ===

  This requires the latest versions of libfuse and libzita convolver to compile.
  .. and a couple of other libs:

  $ sudo aptitude install libsndfile-dev libflac-dev libzita-convolver-dev libfuse-dev fftw3-dev libboost-dev libmicrohttpd-dev
  $ make

=== Run ===

 Fuse convolve requires three parameters: the first is directory to filter
 configurations, the second the directory to the original flac files. The
 third is the mount-point, where the convolved flac files will show up:

  ./fuse-convolve /directory/with/filters /path/to/original/files /mnt/mountpoint -f

Parameters:
  1) The /directory/with/filters needs to be a directory that has
     jconvolver filter-configuration files with the following naming:

       filter-<samplerate>-<bits>-<channels>.conf

     So if you have flac files with 44.1khz, 16 bits and 2 channel stero,
     you need a filter configuration named:

     /directory/with/filters/filter-44100-16-2.conf


  2) The original directory that contains the *.flac files.

  3) The mount point.


The '-f' option lets it run in foreground (useful, since right now this
spits out some debugging information).

Now you can access the fileystem under that mount point, e.g.
  mplayer /mnt/mountpoint/foo.flac

The fuse-convolve filesystem will determine the samplerate/bits/channels and
attempt to find the right filter in the filter directory. If there is a filter,
the output is filtered on-the-fly, otherwise the original file is returned.

There is a http status server running on fixed port 17322 (port not a flag yet)
  http://localhost:17322/
