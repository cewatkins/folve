A fuse filesystem that takes an original path to wav and flac files and provides
these files that are convolved on the fly using the zita convolver (usually
used in jconvolve)

** To compile on Ubuntu **

  $ sudo aptitude install libsndfile-dev libflac-dev libzita-convolver-dev libfuse-dev
  $ make

** Run **
./fuse-convolve filter.conf /path/to/original/fileystem /mnt/mountpoint -f

The '-f' lets it run in foreground (useful, since right now this spits out
some debugging information.

Access fileystem under /mnt/mountpoint, e.g.
  mplayer /mnt/mountpoint/foo.flac

(purely readonly; only reading files is supported).
