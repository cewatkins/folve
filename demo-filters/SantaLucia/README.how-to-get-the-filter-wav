The result of this filter sounds like the music is playing in a big church.

This filter is created from an actual impulse response measurement
in the Santa Lucia Basilica in Bologna, Italy. Measurement is (C) Angelo Farina.

To use this filter, you need to get the IR file from the jconvolver
sample distribution. Issue the following commands in this directory
(which is demo-filters/SantaLucia in Folve)

    wget http://kokkinizita.linuxaudio.org/linuxaudio/downloads/jconvolver-reverbs.tar.bz2
    tar xvjf jconvolver-reverbs.tar.bz2

Now you can add this filter to your Folve invocation with:
  -c demo-filters/SantaLucia
